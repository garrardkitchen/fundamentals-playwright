## Demo 1

**Introduction**

```powershell
mkdir src/demo-1
cd src/demo-1
dotnet new console -f net6.0
dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright --version 1.38.0
dotnet build
pwsh .\bin\Debug\net6.0\playwright.ps1 install
```

ðŸ‘† Note that all engines (chromium, firefox & webkit) are installed

**Prompt engineering**: "Create me c# script using ms playwright to confirm the word google is on the page having navigated to google.com"

```c#
using Microsoft.Playwright;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        await using var browser = await playwright.Firefox.LaunchAsync();
        var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
        await page.GotoAsync("https://google.com");
        var content = await page.ContentAsync();
        bool isGooglePresent = content.Contains("google", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 'google' present on the page? {isGooglePresent}");
    }
}
```

```powershell
dotnet run
```

**Prompt engineering**: "I'd like this script to not be headless" 

```c#
using Microsoft.Playwright;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        await using var browser = await playwright.Firefox.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions { Headless = false });
        var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
        await page.GotoAsync("https://google.com");
        var content = await page.ContentAsync();
        bool isGooglePresent = content.Contains("google", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 'google' present on the page? {isGooglePresent}");
    }
}
```

## Demo 2

**Record automation**

To save file, you need administrators rights:

Open up Powershell Terminal as Administrator, then:

```powershell
net localgroup administrators <username> /add
```

Next, open up Windows Terminal as Administrator.  You'll still get prompt but use your non-admin account to sign in.  

Then:

```powershell
mkdir src/demo-2
cd src/demo-2
dotnet new console -f net6.0
dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright --version 1.38.0
dotnet build
pwsh .\bin\Debug\net6.0\playwright.ps1 install --with-deps firefox
pwsh .\bin\Debug\net6.0\playwright.ps1 codegen https://www.google.com/ -o ./Program.cs -b firefox
```

ðŸ‘† Note that only firefox engines is installed

ðŸ‘† Must press the **record** button

To see what you navigated - headed mode:
```
dotnet run
```


## Demo 3

**Playwright Inspector**

Your scripts might not run.  You can invoke the PW Inspector to help identify issues in your scripts.

```powershell
$env:PWDEBUG=1
dotnet run
```


---

## Demo 4

**Trace**

To see the trace

After line 14 (line 14):

```csharp
var context = await browser.NewContextAsync();
```

enter:

```csharp
var context = await browser.NewContextAsync();
await context.Tracing.StartAsync(new()
{
    Screenshots = true,
    Snapshots = true,
    Sources = true
});
```

then after line `await page.CloseAsync();`, enter:

```csharp
await page.CloseAsync();

await context.Tracing.StopAsync(new()
{
    Path = "trace.zip"
});
```

Now enter this to rerecord your navigation:

```
dotnet run
```

To view the trace:

```powershell
pwsh .\bin\Debug\net6.0\playwright.ps1 show-trace .\trace.zip
```

## Demo 5

Azure Functions App Linux Consumption provisioned using the AZ Developer CLI (AZD)

Click [here](https://github.com/garrardkitchen/playwright-nodejs-func) to go to GitHub repo and follow instructions.

```
# Log in to azd. Only required once per-install.
azd auth logout # avoid any expired refresh tokens; you'll experience multiple auth challenges and a broken DX otherwise
azd auth login

# First-time project setup. Initialize a project in the current directory, using this template. 
azd init --environment "<env-name>" --template https://github.com/garrardkitchen/playwright-nodejs-func

# Provision and deploy to Azure
azd up
```

## Demo-6

Here we create a basic TypeScript sample project, use the Firefox engine only and run the tests.

**Step 1** - Create TS project (but do not install all enginees):

```powershell
npm init playwright@latest -y
...
Getting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:
Initializing project in '.'
âˆš Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript? Â· TypeScript
âˆš Where to put your end-to-end tests? Â· tests
âˆš Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N) Â· false
âˆš Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n) Â· false
...
âœ” Success! Created a Playwright Test project at C:\Users\****\demo-6

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npx playwright test
    Runs the end-to-end tests.

  npx playwright test --ui
    Starts the interactive UI mode.

  npx playwright test --project=chromium
    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    npx playwright test

And check out the following files:
  - .\tests\example.spec.ts - Example end-to-end test
  - .\tests-examples\demo-todo-app.spec.ts - Demo Todo App end-to-end tests
  - .\playwright.config.ts - Playwright Test configuration
```

ðŸ‘† This will have created a config (demo-6/playwright.config.ts) file with defaults. For example, `testDir`, informing where your tests are located

**Step 2** - Install the firefox engine only:

```powershell
npx playwright install firefox
```

Let's not run the tests. this will through up a reports page too. Observe the chromium & webkit tests fail due to us not installing these engines earlier:

**Step 3** - Execute the tests:

```powershell
npx playwright test --project=firefox
```

ðŸ‘† If there are errors, it'll throw up the test report immediately after run

**Step 4** - Show a report:

To see the report:

```powershell
npx playwright show-report
```

**Step 5** - Execute the tests in the UI Mode:

If you want to see the UI debugger:

```powershell
npx playwright test --ui
```

# Code snippets

## Launch Options

This snippet sets a timeout of 3 mins, disables the gpu and ignores all HTTPS related errors. This latter context configuration is helpful when running from a container.

```c#
using Microsoft.Playwright;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        await using var browser = await playwright.Firefox.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions{
            Headless = true,
            Timeout = (1000 * 180),
            Args = new string[] {"--disable-gpu"}
        });
        var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(new BrowserNewContextOptions{
            IgnoreHTTPSErrors = true
        });
        var page = await context.NewPageAsync();
        await page.GotoAsync("https://google.com");
        var content = await page.ContentAsync();
        bool isGooglePresent = content.Contains("google", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 'google' present on the page? {isGooglePresent}");
    }
}
```
